# Algoritmos
This code was writted to measure the response of  sort algorithms (insertion, quicksort, bubblesort and mergesort). 
it's capable to make text files until 20000 numbers sorted intencionally in crease, decrease, half lower and half higher, pair lower higher
and random sort.

sort from lower to higher and gives you the time elapsed, and quantity of changes mades.
thanks!
